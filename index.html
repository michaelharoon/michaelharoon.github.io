            About Michael Haroon, myself!
        </h1>
        <p> Hello!
            This is my first attempt at developing a website.
             I plan on using this website to publish
            pieces of work that I contributed to, and to give 
            informal information about myself.
        </p>

        <p> For those looking for formal information about myself, here is a
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-haroon-b5853322a/"> link </a>
            to my LinkedIn profile.
