            Welcome To Michael's Website!
        </h1>
        <p1> Hello!
            This is my first attempt at developing a website.
            I plan on using this website to publish
            pieces of work that I contributed to, and to give 
            informal information about myself. This website shall change
            substantially and frequently.
        </p1>
        <p2> For those looking for more formal information, here is a 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-haroon-b5853322a/">link</a>
            to my LinkedIn profile. Like this website, my LinkedIn profile is a work in progress.
        </p2>

        If it's my end, reach out to me via LinkedIn and I'll work on it ASAP! Sorry for this inconvinience."

            About Michael
        </h2>
        <p4>
            I am from Southern California. I grew up in
            a Coptic community, and I spent much time with Cambodian and
            African American friends as my neighborhood was predominantly occupied
            by them. Because of my childhood, I have insight to some of the cultures
            of Cambodia and SoCal African American traditions.
        </p4>
        <p5>
            I currently attend UC Berkeley, and I am studying computer science and math.
            I transferred from Long Beach City College, where I had transformative experiences.
            There, I was challenged to become mature as the population was filled with adults
            and was shockingly diverse. I adapted to become a model student in how I behaved.
            I demonstrated patience, tolerance, and an open mind, which opened many opportunities
            for me.

            Tutoring
        </h3>
        <p6>
            As a tutor at Long Beach City College, I realized that students struggled not because they didn't understand the content,
            but because they did not know how <!--italicise "how" --> to learn. The process of learning is not simple, and it depends on the person in question; but,
            a commonality is that people do not ask why <!--italicise "why" --> they are struggling and face the problems. It should be known that all problems
            have solutions <!--italicise "solutions" --> -- maybe not pretty or simple ones, but solutions nonetheless.
        </p6>
        <p7>
            Think of a problem as a tree defined in mathematics. <!-- find a tree online, annotate it to show problem as vertex and why? as edge-->
