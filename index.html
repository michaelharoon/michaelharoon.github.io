            About Michael Haroon, myself!
        </h1>
        <p> Hello!
            This is my first attempt at developing a website.
             I plan on using this website to publish
            pieces of work that I contributed to, and to give 
            informal information about myself.
        </p>
        <img src="Michael_at_SF.jpeg" alt="There's supposed to be a photo of me here, but you got unlucky!
        If it's my end, reach out to me via LinkedIn and I'll work on it ASAP! Sorry for this inconvinience."

        <p> An awkward photo of me at San Francisco -- my first time there! </p>
        <p> For those looking for formal information about myself, here is a
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-haroon-b5853322a/"> link </a>
            to my LinkedIn profile.
