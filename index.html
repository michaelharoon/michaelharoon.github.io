            Welcome To Michael's (Incomplete) Website!
        </h1>
        <p1> Hello!
            This is my first attempt at developing a website.
            I plan on using this website to publish
            pieces of work that I contributed to, and to give 
            informal information about myself; but, as of know, it seems that this website's purpose
            is to just spread my thoughts. 
            <p></p>
            This website shall change
            substantially; its purpose might also change suddenly.
        </p1>
        <p></p>
        <p2> For those looking for more formal information, here is a 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-haroon-b5853322a/">link</a>
            to my LinkedIn profile. Like this website, my LinkedIn profile is a work in progress.

            Background
        </h3>
        <p4>
            I am from Southern California. I grew up in
            a Coptic community, and I spent much time with Cambodian and
            African American friends as my neighborhood was predominantly occupied
            by them. Because of my childhood, I have insight to some of the cultures
            of Cambodia and SoCal African American traditions.
        </p4>
        <p5>
            I currently attend UC Berkeley, and I am studying computer science and math.
            I transferred from Long Beach City College, where I had transformative experiences.
            There, I was challenged to become mature as the population was filled with adults with past lives,
            and the population was shockingly diverse. I adapted to become a model student in how I behaved.
            I demonstrated patience, tolerance, and an open mind -- and I proved my ability to clearly communicate -- all of
            which opened many opportunities for me.

            Tutoring: a Lesson for Everyone
        </h3>
        <p6>
            As a tutor at Long Beach City College, I realized that students struggled not because they didn't understand the content,
            but because they did not know how <!--italicise "how" --> to learn. The process of learning should be simple, but it depends
            on the person in question. A commonality, though, is that people do not ask why <!--italicise "why" --> they are struggling.
            When they do find the reason why they are struggling, they then might not know how to solve the problem, or they found how to solve the problem
            but they do not know how to implement their solution. 
            <p></p>
            Let me regress. <!-- italicize and bolden the leading sentence of this paragraph--> Firstly, it should be known that all problems have solutions <!--italicise "solutions" --> --
            maybe not pretty or simple solutions, but solutions nonetheless.
        </p6>
        <p7> <!--The Problem Graph-->
            Think of the process of solving a problem as a graph.
            <h4> The Problem Graph</h4>
            <p></p>
            <img src="Tutoring_Tree_Diagram.pdf" alt="There should be a tree diagram displaying the process of problems.">
            <p></p>
            The graph above shows an ideal <!-- italicize "ideal" --> scenario. This scenario usually represents the general approach
            to solving simple problems, and it might occur many times within an hour.
            Nevertheless, notice the process. This "mind" identifies the cause, then figures out a solution (or many solutions) to solve
            the problem. Lastly, this mind implements its solution(s). Some solutions might include altering the cause or simply
            removing it entirely. A real example of this diagram is how my roommate recently reduced his stress during pressured times.
            He was overwhelmed, nearly burnt out, and borderline depressed. Instead of succumbing to the stress, he took a break from work
            and gave himself time to think. He wondered why he was overwhelmed, burntout, and depressed. He knew it was school that was the cause,
            but what of school?--: It was his need to pass classes and exams with high marks so that he can be competetive for law school admissions.
            He contimplated how to do so. The first solution was obvious: try hard and do well, which he started doing. But he is not in the position
            where simply putting in time will help, so he needed another solution. He thought that if his grades and scores were not competetive enough,
            then strong letters
            of recommendation were required. He then asked for letters from people he thought would write strongly about him. Finally, he felt relieved
            that there existed a solution to something that felt hopeless.
            <p></p>
            My roommate had a problem, figured the underlying <!--italicize underlying--> cause, found possible solutions, and implemented them. He was no longer
            depressivley stressed. However, solving his main problem led to more problems. This is a given in the life we live. So, the goal
            is to not just solve given problems and become relieved, the goal is to learn how to solve many problems without
            burning out. The key to this is grit.
            
            <h4>
            Grit: the Start and the End
            </h4>
            <p></p>
            Grit is a word packed with too many meanings, and no one understands its abstraction. Grit is the momentum of our lives. When we desire something and have the grit,
