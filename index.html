            Welcome To Michael's Website!
        </h1>
        <p> Hello!
            This is my first attempt at developing a website.
            I plan on using this website to publish
            pieces of work that I contributed to, and to give 
            informal information about myself. This website shall change
            substantially and frequently.
        </p>

        If it's my end, reach out to me via LinkedIn and I'll work on it ASAP! Sorry for this inconvinience."

        <p> For those looking for formal information about myself, here is a
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-haroon-b5853322a/">link</a>
            to my LinkedIn profile. Like this website, my LinkedIn is a work in progress.

            About Michael
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am from Southern California. I grew up in
            a Coptic community, and I spent much time with Cambodian and
            African American friends as my neighborhood was predominantly occupied
            by them. Because of my childhood, I have insight to some of the cultures
            of Cambodia and SoCal African American traditions.

            I grew up on the same block that Artesia Blvd runs through. Those who are
            into hip-hop (especially into Kendrick Lamar) should know the rich
            history of Artesia Blvd!
